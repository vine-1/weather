# weather
HTML: Provides the structure for the weather report interface. It includes an input field for users to enter a city name and a button to fetch weather data.
CSS: Styles the weather card, input fields, and buttons to create a clean and user-friendly interface.
JavaScript: Handles the fetching of weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API (you'll need to sign up for an API key here and replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' in the script with your actual API key). It also dynamically updates the HTML to display the retrieved weather information.
Notes:
This is a basic example. In a real-world application, you would add error handling, consider UI/UX improvements, and potentially expand functionality (e.g., forecast for multiple days, additional weather details).
Ensure to replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual API key from OpenWeatherMap to fetch data successfully.
Always handle errors gracefully when fetching data from APIs, as shown in the example.
This setup should give you a good starting point to build and expand upon a weather report website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
